# Summary
[summary]: #summary

"Ret-cont" recursive Nix is a restricted form of recursive Nix, where one builds a derivations instead of executing builds during the builds.
This avoids some platform-specific contortions relating to nested sandboxing.
More importantly, it prevents imperative and overly linear direct-style build scripts;
easy to write but throwing away the benefits of Nix.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

The benefits of recursive Nix have been described in many places.
One main reason is if we want Nix to function as a build system and package manager, we need upstream packages to use Nix too without duplicating their build systems in Nixpkgs.
The other main reason is other build systems should be translated to Nix without vendoring tons of autogenerated code in Nixpkgs.

"Ret-cont" recursive nix is short for "return-continuation".
Consider direct style recursive "nix-build":
the outer build blocks while the inner one builds, and then continues.
Just as we can CPS-transform programs, reifying the context of a function call as another function passed as an argument, so we can imagine splitting the derivation in two at this blocking point.
This gives the "continuation" part of the name.

But whereas the CPS transformation makes the continuation an argument, the Nix *derivation* language is first order.
Instead, we can produce a derivation which has the callee as a dependency, and continuation drv downstream depending on it.
Since the outer derivation evaluates (builds) the inner derivation rather than calling anything, I deem that it returns the derivation.
This gives the "return" part of the name.

I've always been concerned with the ease of which someone can just "nix-build ...; nix-build ...; nix-build ..." within a derivation with recursive Nix.
This creates a linear chain of dependencies, which isn't terribly performant: shorter critical paths are crucial for parallelism and incrementality and this fails with both.
Building derivations is lot less convenient, but makes linear chains and the proper dependency graph *equally* less convenient, removing the perverse incentive.
And in general, dynamism in the dependency graph, which is the essence of what recursive Nix provides, is only a feature of last resort, so making it more difficult across the board isn't concerning.

Additionally, see https://github.com/edolstra/nix/commit/1a27aa7d64ffe6fc36cfca4d82bdf51c4d8cf717 for Eelco's draft implementation of recursive Nix, and the Darwin sandboxing restriction.
Sandboxing and Darwin are crucial to Nix today, and we shouldn't sacrifice either of them.
With "ret-cont" recursive Nix, actual builds are never nested, so we don't need any fancy constraints on the derivation "runtime" (i.e. the code that actually performs and isolates builds).

# Detailed design
[design]: #detailed-design

Derivations building derivations should have some special attribute indicating this, and two outputs, "store" and "drv".
"store" would be a local Nix store limited to just drvs and fixed output builds.
"drv" would contain a symlink to one of the derivations in the store, the root.
After the build completes, Nix verifies all the drv files and fixed outputs are valid (contents match hashes, etc.) and merges the built store into the ambient store.
\[This should be an untrusted operation because drvs and fixed-output builds are fully verifiable.]
Finally, any uses of the original derivation can be substituted to instead use the symlinked derivation.
\[The substitution of drvs in a downstream derivation reminds me of the substitution of drvs for content hashes with the intensional store.
We should muse on this point when implementing to reduce code and perhaps have good insights.]

The *building* itself of derivations is unchanged:
everything in the previous paragraph just describes marking derivations and post-processing their build results.
Because drvs and produce plans of drvs producing more drvs ad-infinitum, it's possible to never terminate but that's the user's fault.
We can detect simple cycles analogous to black holes in thunks: if a derivation produces a redirected derivation depending on the original, a cycle is effectively recreated even though we don't have a hash fixed point.
\[Instead, the drv->drv substitution would never terminate.]
Nix can should raise an error rather than looping, but either behavior is permissible.

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

 - The opinionated nature may put off those who think Nix is too hard to learn already, and think simple recursive "nix-build" is good for newcomers.

 - If we ever want full recursive Nix, this doesn't really build in that direction.
   It sidesteps the bulk of the difficulty which is in making the nested sandboxing and daemon communication secure.
   To me though, this is a feature not a bug; I don't want to go in that direction just yet.

# Alternatives
[alternatives]: #alternatives

 - Don't allow fixed-output builds.
   All data can be stuck inside the drv file, so this can be cut without limiting expressive power.
   But this is much less efficient, and more cumbersome for whatever produces the data.

 - Use a socket to talk to the host daemon.
   https://github.com/edolstra/nix/commit/1a27aa7d64ffe6fc36cfca4d82bdf51c4d8cf717, a draft implementation of full recursive Nix, has done this and we can take the details from that.
   This might sightly more efficient by reducing moving files, but is conceptual overkill given this design.
   No direct access to the host daemon rules about a bunch of security concerns, and simplifies the interface for non-Nix tools producing derivations.
   The latter I very much hope will happen, just as Ninja is currently used with CMake, Meson, etc., today.

 - Full recursive Nix (builds within builds)

 - Import from derivation.
   This has been traditionally considered an alternative to this, but I will soon propose an implementation of that relying on this; I no longer consider the two in conflict.

 - Keeping the status quo and use vendoring.
   But then Nix will never scale to bridging the package manager and build system divide.

# Unresolved questions
[unresolved]: #unresolved-questions

The exact way the outputs refer to the replacement derivations / their outputs is subject to bikeshedding.

# Future work
[future]: #future-work

A version of IFD that delays evaluation in derivation to keep evaluation non-blocking.
This works on the same principle as this keeps all derivations non-blocking (be they higher order or not).
