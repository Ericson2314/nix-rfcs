# Summary
[summary]: #summary

`nix-daemon` should be a separate executable.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

With flakes and other development, we are moving towards a more "batteries included" Nix command line.
We don't want any of those features in the daemon, however, because the daemon is a special trusted process that we should strive to keep as simple as possible.
\[This is comparable to a compilation pipeline, with a concise intermediate representation that nicer user-facing features "desugar" into.\]

There are many things we could do about this, but I mainly want to establish some rough consensus around the problem while taking a small step to signal that consensus.
Originally, each Nix command was its own executable, but then we combined them into one executable.
I think this is fine for the main user-facing commands, but not good for the daemon.

Finally, it's probably best not to give the daemon---a long lived process running with elevated privileges---access to tons of dead code.
All of the other commands entry points and library functions they use, such as the Nix evaluator, are in the same process even though the daemon should never need to use them.
C++ doesn't exactly prevent memory errors, and that dead code is just more fodder to be used in some low-level attack.
There are other solutions to this in the long term, but this is the easiest solution in the short term.

# Detailed design
[design]: #detailed-design

- `nix-daemon` will be a separate executable that only links the nix libraries it needs.
  \[At this time, those libraries are `libnixutil`, `libnixstore`, and `libnixrust`, but this is subject to change.\]

- `nix-daemon` should never need to understand the expression language and depend  `libnixexpr`.

# Examples and Interactions
[examples-and-interactions]: #examples-and-interactions

I certainly hope there are no interactions!
One of the bad things we should seek to prevent with this is the daemon unintentionally growing dependencies on more of the code base.

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

Installation is slightly bigger as the two binaries (`nix` and `nix-daemon`) have some redundancy.
Build rules perhaps are slightly more complex as there are both separate and independent executables.

# Alternatives
[alternatives]: #alternatives

 - Do nothing.

 - Something more invasive, such as packaging the libraries and commands separately, or intending the libaries for widespread public consumption.
   But I much rather save that for later, as such steps would be far more controversial.

# Unresolved questions
[unresolved]: #unresolved-questions

No known unknowns.

# Future work
[future]: #future-work

I think most people for this will have future plans they wish to persue in the name of modularity.
But I don't expect everyone to agree on what exactly those plans should be.
The point of this small step is to punt on all that for now.
